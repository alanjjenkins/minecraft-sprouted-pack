	- Cyberware: Reduced time for scanner operation, and increased its success chance
	- Terraqueous: Disabled endimium ore. It doesn't have much use, so just craft it.

	- Made the Slayer's guild a bit rarer - should result in less cases of all 5 copies spawning close to each other
	- Overhauled the substructures used to spawn NPCs. Now is completely vertical with a 1x3x1 footprint, so should be less likely to get stuck unactivated in partially genned structures

		- For existing worlds: manually delete the "<world>/customNPCs/spawns.dat" file for this to take effect

	- Add "Purchased from Weaver" tooltip to Silk (Both packmodes)

	- Terraqueous 1.2.22

- Removed:
	- JustEnoughResources. Since it doesn't update to reflect loot-tables changed using the vanilla system, it was displaying inaccurate info
	- ArchitectureCraft - was causing quite a few different crashes, with no fixes on the horizon
	- AppliedEnergistics2 - I got sick of the texture issue with I&F, and it hasn't been updated since December
	- AE2Stuff - Cos it requires AE2
	- BDLib - Was only being used by AE2Stuff
- Disabled a lot of things from Camping Mod, and hid them in JEI
- Rewrote a lot of recipes that were looking for specifically the vanilla versions of meats so as to allow usage of animania meats
- Rewrote the recipes for the trough and nest from animania to be more oredict accepting
- Reenable heart crystal ore, gets more common the further from spawn you go
- Conversely, disabled containers dropping from blights
- Added Sag Mill recipe for doubling Vinteum Ore and Chaos Ore, since they were already able to be doubled by most other methods
- Removed the recipe for heart crystal shards -> heart container, will now be done using one of the new NPCs
- Added 18 heart crystal shards to the starter kit (enough to buy 2 heart containers), along with a waystone. Also swapped out the CampingMod Sleeping bag for the SleepingBag mod's one
- Changed the reward for "Finding Nests" from an ExU wooden sickle to a SG flint sickle, to keep consistency of first tools being flint based
- Fixed DT ore bags looking for incorrect ids for SG ores
- Alter the way NPCs were spawning in a bunch of structures so they will be able to spawn if the structure gens near worldspawn
	- All future NPCs will be spawned using this method
- Rearrange the AM2 HUD settings to fit with the new HUD
- Increase the coins recieved for loose hay from the Miller
- New NPCs with related structures: Monk, Stablemaster, Weaver, Hunter, Tinkerer
	- Tinkerer duplicates scavenger looted items for making scavenger mode more viable on servers
- Disabled Chisel raw marble and Astral Sorcery marble from worldgen. Quark marble still generates and can be chiseled into the others. AS marble is also still found in its structures
- Disabled Chisel Limestone from genning too, likewise, the remaining quark limestone is chiselable
- Mobs that spawn with Silent's Gems equipment will no longer have a chance to drop it on death
- If in scavenger mode, affected items now indicate as much on their tooltip
- Ice&Fire armours are now scavenger affected
- Grapple hooks, BM snares, and AA display stands now affected by Scavenger mode
- Added AM2 Soulbound to the list of things TMG won't collect in the grave (letting it actually function and follow you)
- Disabled EIO soulbound, and made the Enchanter recipe for EIO soulbound produce AM2 soulbound instead (EIO soulbound was being buggy with its interaction with TMG)
- Removed eggs from birdsnests. Omelets are really good food, if you want them, work for them by farming chickens
- Prevent Sirens, Ant workers and Bears from spawning within 1500 blocks of spawn
- Change the smelting output of Aquaculture tin cans to give tin rather than iron (except in the ExU2 furnace, cos that's an untweakable special snowflake)
- Added recipe to convert a Snow Villager Soul Vial into a vanilla Villager Soul Vial to make the Enticing Crystal craftable
- Tweak the recipe for the AA crate to be a bit more expensive - rather than being an all around upgrade you're giving up storage space for the benefit of it taking up less physical space
- Removed ArchitectureCraft blocks from all structures
- Removed CampingMod blocks from structures
- Disabled JWIN Oredict pickup conversion due to a dupe bug interaction
- Tweak AM2 blank rune recipe slightly
- Moved the crafting of Supercharged Gems, and enriched chaos to the AA empowerer, BM Hellfire Forge, and Botania Runic Altar
	- Will probably get added to the AS altar at somepoint too, once I can understand what progression there would match the other options
- Removed the non-gem-based recipes for the LIT furnace upgrades
- Made Ender Eye Mobs a bit more common
- Flint instead of Wood mod is now controlling the requirement for an axe to cut logs, hopefully does it better than IMC did
- Easy methods of flight are currently disabled in scavenger mode. They will be available again eventually, but method as yet undecided. 
	- The purpose of this is to encourage using dragons as a means of transport
- NOTE: Neat may be removed in the future. RPGHUD now has an entity health bar feature which fits better with the rest of the UI


0.7.1
- Added Village Names and Scaling Health
- Fixed BigAl's Mill structure and the Dark Xanmeer - They had issues due to including blocks from EnvTech
- Move MCA's crystal ball to the starter kit rather than spawning with it
- Scaling Health configured so you start with 10 health (equivalent to 5 hearts), and mobs get stronger the farther from spawn you go
    - Rate of scaling not yet finalized, may be tweaked as needed
    - Left a small chance for heart canisters to drop from regular mobs, and more readily from Blight variants, as a stop-gap until I can implement proper ways to get more health
- Altered the versioning to better accomodate small fixes like this
Known Issues:
- Ice&Fire bug from 0.7 still in play
- Starting with Silent's Gems Guide is unintententional as it is part of the starter kit, but am currently waiting on addition of config to not spawn with it

0.7

- Added Animania, Minecolonies, Minecraft Comes Alive, RPG HUD, Ice&Fire
- Removed Environmental Tech (+ValkyrieLib)(yes this is going to leave big holes in existing worlds), Embers, Psi, Psionic upgrades
- Updated a bunch of mods. I swear I'll keep better track of this once I actually do a public release
- Added the ability bottle to scavenger mode
- Added the Archaeologist NPC, gives tutorial about ability totems
- Added the Banker and Teller NPCs. Banker gives access to item bank, teller converts coins between types

- Edited default ReC loot pools
- Edited waterstrainer pools to incorporate items from aquaculture, and the fish from dungeontactics
Known Issue: A bug caused by a conflict with AE2 means most of the items and blocks in Ice&Fire show up as missing textures. This should be fixed soonish

- disabled moving spawners with chest transporters
- First NPC content - traveller at spawn for a brief getting started tutorial, armourers and millers in villages
- removed a bunch of armour, totems and AA drill cores from various loot pools
- added a few things to some loot pools, more still to be done on this
- If in scavenger mode, some (read: quite a few) armour types are still as yet unobtainable, pending inclusion of more NPC structures, quests and minibosses

0.5
- Armour scavenging!
	- All Armour is now affected by scavenger mode - buy armour grab bags at new merchants in villages
	- NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED AS OF PRE5 DUE TO PRE5 BEING FOR GROUP BUILDING PURPOSES
- Removed Builders Guides
- Swapped The One Probe + TOP addons for HWYLA and WAILA Harvestability
- Added Ambient Sounds, Astral Sorcery

0.4
- Added Embers, Holographic Victory Monument, Literal Ascension, Terraqueous, Earthworks, Ars Magicka 2 Reloaded, Bibliocraft and Custom NPCs
- Removed Forestry, Gendustry, JEI Bees, Deep Resonance (and ElecCore)
- Added Custom structures to Recurrent Complex for specific items
	- Many such structures will be used for obtaining items needed for various mods.
		- In the newly added Scavenger mode (same system as used by FTB Infinity and PO2 etc) these structures will be the only way to get these items
			- At this stage only Botania's Pure Daisy is affected by Scavenger mode, but this will be expanded soon enough
- When you start a world you now spawn with a warp stone and a waystone structure at spawn
	- This serves as an ingame grounded alternative to the FTBUtils /spawn command (which along with /home and /back is disabled)
- Tweaks to how everlasting abilities are earned:
	- You no longer spawn with an ability bottle - you will need to craft one
	- Totems no longer drop from mobs with glowing particles - thay are now specifically obtained from various structures, with different abilities being in different structures.
	- Can only have a maximum of 6 different abilities active at any one time

0.3
- Updated a few mods
- Swapped Expandable Backpacks out for Iron Backpacks
- Added LIT and Gemulation
- Fixed oregen (lead, silver, copper and tin were previously only available through RC mine style gen) 
	- forestry now provides copper and tin, while IE provides lead, silver, bauxite and nickel
- reduced chance of getting Levels' void ability on armour
